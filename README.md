# contact-form-e2e
\
This is an end to end contact form with NO BACKEND. I wanted to build one with just HTML and CSS and then build the same form with a Nodejs Backend to compare. 
With this I used personalized SMTP and Elastic credentials to handle the data in lieu of what a backend would do. Once user clicks send, the data is sent to the 
email address I designated. This was a fun project because it involved requesting data from a user, providing assists (validator) and receiving user data needed.
